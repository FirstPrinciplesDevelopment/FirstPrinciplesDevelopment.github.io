Imagine your exact brain state can be uploaded to a synthetic body, allowing you to live on after the death of your body. You are anesthetized, your brain state is uploaded to your new synthetic body and your biological body is destroyed. You regain conciousness as a cybernetic being with a perfect memory of your life up until the anesthesia, and now you get to keep living and make new memories.

*How does this make you feel?*

There was a slight mishap -- after the upload, your dying, biological body regained conciousness for a few minutes before dying of natural causes. You know the upload succeeded, but you know you are now about to experience death.

*How does this make you feel?*

Once I come to and realize that I'm now recording memories that won't live on in the new me, the new me loses all value to me. This is strange, because it could be just 10 minutes of life and the terror of death (which would be alleviated in the first case), now returns in full. I no longer identify with my new self, because of our temporal overlap, and I see it not as me but like a clone. All is not lost however, the facility kindly allows me to re-upload my brain my brain to take into account the new experiences and memories I've had and I am promised I'll really have a seamless experience this time, where my old biological body will die and my new synthetic body will awake and feel normal. Now when I wake up in  my new synthetic body, I really do feel like I survived the death of my mortal, biological body! Of course, I feel a bit unsettled by the fact that there were two versions of me in existence contemporaneously, but all in all I'm extremely relieved to have avoided the terror of death. My biological body ended its life with the knowledge that my existence was not ending, and my new synthetic body now has those memories and feels no different than if my biological body had simply been given remarkable drug therapy while anesthetized in order to live indefinitely -- therefore, the existential horror of death has been avoided. 

Of course, this is just a thought experiment. Why did I imagine I would experience waking up in the old body, and see in horror that the new body had not "picked up" my selfhood out of it? Why not imagine waking up in the new body and seeing that the old body is still alive and concious (oops!) and feeling pity and compassion for the dying person... but not, of course, identifying with it as the same "self"!

Of course, the two bodies are different, physically. There are two persons, distinct from one another, and no one would imagine they could simultaneously share a notion of "self". However, imagining this fork in the road of concious experience, where two persons with all of my memories exist for a moment in time (and then immediately begin to form new memories and diverge), and trying to imagine which one I would inhabit as a "self", motivates for me that something about the notion of the self is not as it seems. It can't possibly exists in the way I imagine it to.
