>Note: the plausibility of the medical procedure described is not important to this thought experiment. Your intuition about what you would experience, were it to happen, and how that intuition shapes your beliefs about your "self" are important.

You are diagnosed with an aggressive cancer that will certainly kill you in a matter of days. This is unwelcome news, but fortunately for you, you live in a time when scientific progress has made possible the once unimaginable: the exact state of your nervous system can be captured in a snapshot, and transferred to a new, lab-grown, synthetic body. Needless to say, the human lifespan has increased dramatically, and most people make the switch to a new,  eternally-youthful body once their health begins to decline. Dying friends and family members who went to the renewal clinic returned in perfect health and good spirits, in lab-grown bodies made in the image of their owners in their primes.

After considering your options, you find yourself lying in a hospital bed, your medical team preparing you for the renewal procedure. Your told, "We'll give you an anesthetic, and slowly lower your core temperature. We need to slow down your body's processes enough for the transfer to take place. Once your heart stops beating, the transfer will take place. In a few hours you'll wake up in your new, healthy body". You give the thumbs up, nervous, but not terrified, and count down from 10.

You wake up, and recall your most recent memories: lying in a bed like the one you're in now, listening to your doctors explain the procedure to you. You notice that you feel good, better than you have in years. You sit up and walk to the bathroom, where you're delighted to see the face of your 30 year old self grinning back at you. A nurse comes into your room and asks you a series of questions to determine if your memory and mental faculties are intact. You check all the boxes, and you're taken to a room where you can change back into your clothes. On your way out of the facility you're asked to sign out and rate your experience: 5 stars.

*~~Make a mental note of how you imagine you would have felt going through that experience.~~*

Let's rewind a bit and consider another outcome. You give the thumbs up, nervous, but not terrified, and count down from 10.

You wake up, and recall your most recent memories: lying in a bed like the one you're in now, listening to your doctors explain the procedure to you. You feel cold and groggy, and upon opening your eyes, know for certain you're in your old body, and you're still dying. The fear of death, which was absent before, rushes in with full force. With an effort, you get to your feet and rush out of the room and across the hall to the room you know your new body was meant to occupy. You find it already abandoned, but the chart left there reveals to you that the transfer was a success and the new you has checked out of the facility. But it isn't really you, can't be you, because you're here, experiencing this. And you're terrified, because you're dying, and this time, there is nothing to alleviate your existential fear.

These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive. At the moment the transfer completes, there are two unconscious versions of you with the identical mental state. Either one or both can regain consciousness, and then begin diverging from this mental state by having new experiences and forming new memories. The question is which body you actually wake up in, if you wake up at all. If the old body never comes to, is your intuition that you wake up in the new body? If both bodies regain consciousness, is your intuition that you wake up in the old body?

Of course, the two bodies are different, physically. There are two persons, distinct from one another. For me, imagining this fork in the road of the continuity of self, where two persons with all of my memories exist for a moment in time (and then immediately begin to form new memories and diverge), and trying to imagine which one I would inhabit as a "self", motivates for me that something about my intuitive sense of the self is not as it seems.

A related thought experiment is the Ship of Theseus.
> "...for they took away the old planks as they decayed,
  putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this
  ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical
  question as to things that grow; one side holding that the ship
  remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same."

  - [*Plutarch's Lives*, by A. H. Clough](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/674/674-h/674-h.htm#2H_4_0001)

If the procedure in the renewal clinic seems too far-fetched to you, consider a different procedure, one akin to what the Athenians did to the ship of Theseus: every cell in your body is replaced with fresh, new ones. This could be all at once, in a futuristic medical procedure, or more slowly, as your body naturally replaces each cell. What makes you feel like you're the same you?

Imagine your exact brain state can be uploaded to a synthetic body, allowing you to live on after the death of your body. You are anesthetized, your brain state is uploaded to your new synthetic body and your biological body is destroyed. You regain consciousness as a sort of cyborg with a faithful memory of your life up until the anesthesia, and now you get to keep living and make new memories.

*How does this make you feel?*

There was a slight mishap -- after the upload, biological body regained consciousness for a few minutes before dying of natural causes. As you expire, you know the upload succeeded, but you know you are now about to experience death.

*How does this make you feel?*

In those few minutes, once I realize that I'm now recording memories that won't live on in the new me, the new me loses all value to me. This is strange, because it could be just 2 minutes of life and the terror of death (which would be alleviated in the first case), now returns in full. I no longer identify with my new self, because of our temporal overlap, and I see it not as me but like a clone. All is not lost however, the facility kindly allows me to re-upload my brain to take into account the new experiences and memories I've had and I am promised I'll really have a seamless experience this time, where my old biological body will die and my new synthetic body will awake and feel normal. Now when I wake up in  my new synthetic body, I really do feel like I survived the death of my mortal, biological body! Of course, I feel a bit unsettled by the fact that there were two versions of me in existence contemporaneously, but all in all I'm extremely relieved to have avoided the terror of death. My biological body ended its life with the knowledge that my existence was not ending, and my new synthetic body now has those memories and feels no different than if my biological body had simply been given remarkable drug therapy while anesthetized in order to live indefinitely -- therefore, the existential horror of death has been avoided.

Of course, this is just a thought experiment. Why did I imagine I would experience waking up in the old body, and see in horror that the new body had not "picked up" my selfhood out of it? Why not imagine waking up in the new body and seeing that the old body is still alive and conscious (oops!) and feeling pity and compassion for the dying person... but not, of course, identifying with it as the same "self"!

Of course, the two bodies are different, physically. There are two persons, distinct from one another, and no one would imagine they could simultaneously share a notion of "self". However, imagining this fork in the road of conscious experience, where two persons with all of my memories exist for a moment in time (and then immediately begin to form new memories and diverge), and trying to imagine which one I would inhabit as a "self", motivates for me that something about the notion of the self is not as it seems. It can't possibly exist in the way I imagine it to.

### questions
- did the idea of having the contents of your brain transferred to the new body alleviate your existential fear of death?
- if the transfer were successful and your old body never came to (but rather expired as planned), would the self that you feel you had transfer to the new body?
