> I often have conversations with friends and family who want a website. I love these conversations and this is in no way an attempt to avoid them, however I've realized the advice I give is generic, so I've summarized it below for anyone who finds it helpful.

### **TL;DR: a website builder (e.g. Wix, Weebly, Squarespace) will handle most people's needs.**

## Domains

A domain name, e.g. [firstprinciplesdevelopment.com](https://firstprinciplesdevelopment.com), allows people to find your website. If you want to save money, you can use a subdomain of the sitebuilder you choose, although domains can be had cheaply (less than $15/year) and many sitebuilders offer the first year's domain registration free of charge. Registering your domain through the sitebuilder you choose could make sense, because it will simplify the management of your digital property, but I recommend _searching_ for your domain using [google's domain search](https://domains.google/) because it's super fast and allows you to see availability and pricing without signing up. Once you've found a domain you like that is available, you can register (purchase) it through whatever registrar you like, google may be convenient if you plan to use google workspace for email, your sitebuilder could be a convenient option as well. If you're being charged more than $15/year for a `.com` domain, you're probably being overcharged. If you're being charged for _privacy protection_, you're being overcharged; most registrars provide this service (it is a real service) at no additional cost, and you should make sure it is enabled so that your email or other information is not made public. One last thing: choose a `.com` if you can. If your audience consists of software developers, you can get away with a weird TLD (top level domain) like `.io`, but otherwise, people expect your website to have a common TLD (`.com`, _maybe_ `.org` or `.net`).

## Websites

If you want to make a website without writing any code or doing anything too technical, you have basically two options: use a _no-code_ tool to build your site or hire someone technical (i.e. a web developer) to build it for you. There is a a gray area in the middle as well, with platforms such as wordpress, where you needn't write any code, but you do have to learn how to use an unintuitive CMS (Content Management System), and with wordpress or sitebuilders that allow you to hire a web designer to customize your site. I have a strong bias against wordpress, so I never recommend it, but something like half of all websites use it, and there is a large ecosystem of plugins to extend the functionality of your site. Website builders are my recommendation for most people. Blogs and portfolio sites especially, but even ecommerce sites can be handled by no-code website builders.

#### Website Builders (D.I.Y.)

There are tons of no-code tools that let anybody build a good-looking website. Wix, Weebly, Squarespace, and many other website builders let you choose pre-made themes, customize them and build pages with intuitive drag-and-drop editors. I won't do a comparison, because I don't use them, but the folks at [PC Magazine wrote a comparison](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-website-builders).

#### Something More

A web developer can, with enough resources, build any website imaginable. On the other hand, you can only build with a website builder what that product has already imagined and implemented. If this is too constraining for your vision, you may need something custom built. Get in touch, I'd love to help you out.


## Email

Here are 3 reasonable options:

- #### Gmail/Google Workspace

  Gmail is free if you don't want to use a custom domain, and google workspace is $6/month (at time of writing) if you want to use a custom domain (e.g. contact@firstprinciplesdevelopment.com).

- #### Proton Mail

  Protonmail is privacy focused and has free and paid plans. You'll need to pay around $5/month if you want to use a custom domain. While google will likely scan the contents of your emails and proton (maybe) won't, don't believe all the marketing copy: email is not very secure or private, and as soon as you send an email to somebody, what happens to that information is out of your control.

- #### Zoho Mail
  A budget option, zoho mail offers a free plan with limited features for a custom domain. It isn't easy to find, search "Forever Free Plan" on [this page](https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html). Plus, their cheapest paid plan is only $1/month.

## When To Hire A Developer

When not to hire a web developer: for most portfolio, blog, and informational, static (minimally-interactive) websites. If you require user accounts, transactional email,
